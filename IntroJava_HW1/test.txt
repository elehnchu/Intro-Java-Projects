<Minutes.java>
    I started off with getting input from the user for both the days and weeks, 
In order order to calculate the minutes you have to do basic conversion math to 
get the values being multiplied (1440 and 10080) so the values are in minutes
,and then in the end I just outputted the number of minutes.


<Average.java>
    This one was probably the trickiest. I didn't really know how to start but I knew
I had to incorporate some sort of loop, hence the "while". In order to ensure the loop 
kept running as the user continued to input values, I needed to declare an integer and set a 
value (hence sum= 0). Once in the loop, the code would consistently ask for a new number if the 
user wished for it to be included with the average, and then I output the average results.

<Easter.java>
    This one was easier than I thought it was going to be. I essentially just got the year input
from the user, and then followed what each step wanted me to do, alternating between / and %, and
then for the output, I just put the day and month as an integer.
